# VMR Codeflow Reference

## Key Concepts

### Codeflow Types
- **Backflow** (VMR → product repo): Automated PRs created by Maestro that bring VMR source updates + dependency updates into product repos (e.g., `dotnet/sdk`). These are titled `[branch] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet`.
- **Forward flow** (product repo → VMR): Changes from product repos flowing into the VMR. These are titled `[branch] Source code updates from dotnet/<repo>`.

### Staleness
When a product repo pushes changes to the VMR (forward flow merges) while a backflow PR is already open, Maestro blocks further codeflow updates to that PR. The bot posts a warning comment with options:
1. Merge the PR as-is, then Maestro creates a new PR with remaining changes
2. Close the PR and let Maestro open a fresh one (loses manual commits)
3. Force trigger: `darc trigger-subscriptions --id <subscription-id> --force` (manual commits may be reverted)

### Key Files
- **`src/source-manifest.json`** (in VMR): Tracks the exact commit SHA for each product repo synchronized into the VMR. This is the authoritative source of truth.
- **`eng/Version.Details.xml`** (in product repos): Tracks dependencies and includes a `<Source>` tag for codeflow tracking.

## PR Body Metadata Format

Codeflow PRs have structured metadata in their body:

```
[marker]: <> (Begin:<subscription-id>)
## From https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet
- **Subscription**: [<subscription-id>](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=<subscription-id>)
- **Build**: [<build-number>](<azdo-build-url>) ([<bar-id>](<maestro-channel-url>))
- **Date Produced**: <date>
- **Commit**: [<vmr-commit-sha>](<vmr-commit-url>)
- **Commit Diff**: [<from>...<to>](<compare-url>)
- **Branch**: [<branch>](<branch-url>)
[marker]: <> (End:<subscription-id>)
```

## Darc CLI Commands

The `darc` tool (Dependency ARcade) manages dependency flow in the .NET ecosystem. Install via `eng\common\darc-init.ps1` in any arcade-enabled repo.

### Essential Commands for Codeflow Analysis

#### Get subscription details
```bash
# Find all subscriptions flowing to a repo
darc get-subscriptions --target-repo dotnet/sdk --source-repo dotnet/dotnet

# Output shows subscription ID, channel, update frequency, merge policies
```

#### Trigger a codeflow update
```bash
# Normal trigger (only works if not stale)
darc trigger-subscriptions --id <subscription-id>

# Force trigger (works even when stale, but may revert manual commits)
darc trigger-subscriptions --id <subscription-id> --force

# Trigger with a specific build
darc trigger-subscriptions --id <subscription-id> --build <bar-build-id>
```

#### Get build information
```bash
# Get BAR build details by ID (found in PR body or AzDO logs)
darc get-build --id <bar-build-id>

# Get latest build for a repo on a channel
darc get-latest-build --repo dotnet/dotnet --channel ".NET 11 Preview 1"
```

#### Check subscription health
```bash
# See if dependencies are missing subscriptions or have issues
darc get-health --channel ".NET 11 Preview 1"
```

#### Simulate a subscription update locally
```bash
# Dry-run to see what a subscription would update
darc update-dependencies --subscription <subscription-id> --dry-run
```

### VMR-Specific Commands

```bash
# Resolve codeflow conflicts locally
darc vmr resolve-conflict --subscription <subscription-id> --build <bar-build-id>

# Flow source from VMR → local repo
darc vmr backflow --subscription <subscription-id>

# Flow source from local repo → local VMR
darc vmr forwardflow --subscription <subscription-id>

# Get version (SHA) of a repo in the VMR
darc vmr get-version

# Diff VMR vs product repos
darc vmr diff
```

### Halting and Restarting Dependency Flow

- **Disable default channel**: `darc default-channel-status --disable --id <id>` — stops new builds from flowing
- **Disable subscription**: `darc subscription-status --disable --id <id>` — stops flow between specific repos
- **Pin dependency**: Add `Pinned="true"` to dependency in `Version.Details.xml` — prevents specific dependency from updating

## VMR Backflow vs Dependency Subscriptions

Product repos receive two kinds of subscriptions:
- **VMR backflow** (source: `dotnet/dotnet`): Carries source code sync + dependency updates. PRs titled `[branch] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet`.
- **Dependency subscriptions** (source: another product repo, e.g., `dotnet/hot-reload-test-framework`): Carry only package version updates.

Both target the same branch but have different failure patterns — don't confuse a stuck dependency subscription with a VMR backflow problem.

## Branch Naming per Repo

Different repos use different branch naming conventions for the same .NET version:

| Repo group | Branch pattern | Example (.NET 10) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| `runtime`, `aspnetcore`, `efcore`, `winforms`, `wpf` | `release/X.0` | `release/10.0` |
| `sdk` | `release/X.0.Nxx` | `release/10.0.1xx`, `release/10.0.3xx` |
| `msbuild` | `vsNN.N` (VS version numbering) | `vs18.0` (.NET 10), `vs17.14` (servicing) |
| `roslyn` | `release/devNN.0` | `release/dev18.0` (.NET 10). **Formula**: VS major = .NET major + 8. |
| Current dev (all repos) | `main` | `main` |
| **Preview** | `release/X.0-previewN` or `release/X.0.1xx-previewN` | `release/11.0-preview2` |

## SDK Bands and Forward Flow

The SDK band determines what flows where. The **1xx band** is the full source-build band; higher bands consume some components as prebuilt packages:

| Band | VMR branch | runtime/aspnetcore forward flow? | Example |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------|---------|
| 1xx | `release/X.Y.1xx` or `main` | ✅ Yes — full source build | `.NET 11.0.1xx SDK` |
| 2xx | `release/X.Y.2xx` | ❌ No — consumed as prebuilts from 1xx | `.NET 10.0.2xx SDK` |
| 3xx | `release/X.Y.3xx` | ❌ No — consumed as prebuilts from 1xx | `.NET 10.0.3xx SDK` |

**Missing runtime forward flow on a 2xx/3xx branch is expected, not broken.** Only SDK, roslyn, fsharp, nuget, and arcade have forward flow on higher bands.

## Subscription History Patterns

When checking `maestro_subscription_history`, these patterns indicate specific problems:

- **`ApplyingUpdates` failure**: Maestro couldn't create or update the PR branch — typically a git conflict or API error. If this is a one-off, Maestro will retry on the next build.
- **`MergingPullRequest` failure**: PR exists but merge failed — usually CI checks blocking auto-merge, or branch protection rules preventing the merge.
- **Alternating `ApplyingUpdates` / `MergingPullRequest` failures**: A chronic pattern spanning weeks or months indicates a systemic problem — not normal retry. Usually means: (a) an unresolved conflict that recurs on each attempt, (b) persistently failing CI checks, or (c) a forward flow PR blocking backflow. Investigate the PR directly.
- **Long gap with no entries**: Either the subscription is disabled, the channel has no new builds (check build freshness), or the subscription is on a `None` (manual) update frequency.
- **Single old failure then silence**: Subscription may have been disabled after a failure, or the channel was frozen after a preview shipped. Check `maestro_subscription` for the enabled/disabled state.

## Common Scenarios

### 1. Codeflow is stale — a fix landed but hasn't reached the PR
**Symptoms**: Tests failing on the codeflow PR; the fix is merged in a product repo.
**Diagnosis**: Compare `source-manifest.json` on VMR branch HEAD vs the PR's VMR snapshot commit.
**Resolution**: Close PR + reopen, or force trigger the subscription.

### 2. Opposite codeflow merged — staleness warning
**Symptoms**: Maestro bot comment saying "codeflow cannot continue".
**Diagnosis**: Check PR comments for the warning. Check if forward flow PRs merged after the backflow PR was opened.
**Resolution**: Follow the options in the bot's comment.

### 3. Manual commits on the codeflow PR
**Symptoms**: Developers added manual fixes to unblock the PR (baseline updates, workarounds).
**Diagnosis**: Analyze PR commits to identify non-maestro commits.
**Risk**: Closing the PR loses these. Force-triggering may revert them.

### 4. Script reports "Maestro may be stuck"
**Symptoms**: Builds are fresh (aka.ms shows recent publish) but no backflow PR was created.
**Diagnosis**:
1. Check the subscription to find when it last consumed a build:
   ```bash
   darc get-subscriptions --target-repo <repo> --source-repo dotnet/dotnet
   ```
   Look at the `Last Build` field — if it's weeks old while the channel has newer builds, the subscription is stuck.
2. Compare against the latest channel build:
   ```bash
   darc get-latest-build --repo dotnet/dotnet --channel "<channel-name>"
   ```
3. Trigger the subscription manually:
   ```bash
   darc trigger-subscriptions --id <subscription-id>
   ```
4. If triggering doesn't produce a PR within a few minutes, check Maestro health or open an issue on `dotnet/arcade`.
